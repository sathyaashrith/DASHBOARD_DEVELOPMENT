*DESCRIPTION*: 

The primary objective of this task is to create an interactive dashboard using data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash to visualize a dataset. The dashboard should provide actionable insights, enabling users to explore the data, identify trends, and make informed decisions. This task requires a combination of data analysis, visualization, and design skills to create a user-friendly and informative dashboard.

To complete this task, you will need to follow these steps:

Firstly, you will need to select a dataset to visualize. The dataset should be relevant to a business problem or a real-world scenario, and it should contain a sufficient number of records to enable meaningful analysis. You can use publicly available datasets or collect your own data using surveys, APIs, or other methods.

Once you have selected the dataset, you will need to clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for visualization. This involves handling missing values, data normalization, and data transformation to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

Next, you will need to choose a data visualization tool to create the dashboard. Popular options include Tableau, Power BI, and Dash. Each tool has its strengths and weaknesses, and you should select the tool that best suits your needs and skill level.

After selecting the tool, you will need to design the dashboard layout and user interface. The dashboard should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear and concise labels, titles, and instructions. You should also ensure that the dashboard is visually appealing, with a consistent color scheme, typography, and layout.

The dashboard should include a variety of visualizations, such as charts, tables, maps, and gauges, to provide a comprehensive view of the data. You should select the most appropriate visualization for each dataset, taking into account the type of data, the level of detail, and the intended audience.

In addition to visualizations, the dashboard should also include interactive elements, such as filters, drill-down capabilities, and what-if scenarios, to enable users to explore the data in more detail. These interactive elements should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and minimal clutter.

Finally, the dashboard should provide actionable insights, enabling users to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data. You should include clear and concise recommendations, based on the analysis, to help users make informed decisions.

The deliverable for this task is a fully functional dashboard that provides actionable insights and enables users to explore the data in more detail. The dashboard should be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing, with clear and concise labels, titles, and instructions.

The dashboard should include a variety of visualizations, interactive elements, and actionable insights, as described above. You should also include a brief report, not more than two pages, that summarizes the key findings, insights, and recommendations from the Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Technical soundness: accuracy and effectiveness of the dashboard in visualizing the data and providing actionable insights
- Design and usability: clarity, concision, and visual appeal of the dashboard, as well as its ease of use and navigation
- Insight and recommendations: quality and relevance of the insights and recommendations provided, as well as their potential impact on business decisions
